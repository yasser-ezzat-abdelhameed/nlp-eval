# NLP Eval Project

NLP Eval "Natural Language Processing Evaluation" project is a simple web app which integrates with aylien-news-api.
This is the fourth project in the [Front End Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011)

## Project setup

- Download or clone the project
- Run `npm i`
- Create an [Aylien](https://aylien.com/news-api/) dev account, then get both API_ID and API_KEY from the dashboard
- Create an `.env` file at the project's root directory, then add both API_ID and API_KEY
- To run a dev build run `npm run build-dev`
- To run a production build run `npm run build-prod`
- To start the backend server run `npm start`

## How it works

- When you launch the web app with a web browser, you are going to see a web page with a form which has a textfield and a submit button.
- Type in the textfield the word which you like to pass it to the news api and click submit.
- You should be able to see the results of your search right below the form box.
